## Getting Started

You'll need to install the required packages (in terminal utilize the "npm i" command).  Once the file is open in terminal/cmd/vs code terminal, you will need to run it by typing "node ./app.js".  Once the file runs, answer the questions.  After you answer the questions, a file team.html and index.html will be modified with the information provided.  

If any questions arise, visit my page at https://korkdaork.github.io and go to the contact page.  You can send me an e-mail and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible (based on the amount of correspondence I get).
